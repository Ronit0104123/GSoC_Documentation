## 1. Project Goals  

The goal of my GSoC project was to enhance the **graph exploration** and **query interface** of the Internet Health Report platform, making it more interactive and user-friendly.  

To achieve this, I worked on:  

- **Node Expansion in Graph View** – Allowing users to expand nodes dynamically after clicking, enabling deeper exploration of connected data without rerunning queries.  

- **Intelligent Cypher Query Completion** – Implementing context-aware code completion that suggests only valid node properties and relationships, helping users write accurate queries more easily.  

- **Improved Query Editor Experience** – Enhancing the Cypher editor with auto-adjusting height while maintaining readability by enabling scrolling after a fixed maximum size.  


## 2. Implementation
The project follows a **[architecture or approach]** for modularity and maintainability.  

Key steps:  
1. Step one  
2. Step two  
3. Step three
